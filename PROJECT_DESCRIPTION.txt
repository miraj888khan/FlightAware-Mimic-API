PROJECT: FlightAware Mimic API
================================

DESCRIPTION:
A Python FastAPI application that mimics the core functionality of a flight tracking service like FlightAware. It provides real-time flight tracking, data ingestion, and interactive map visualization capabilities.

KEY FEATURES:
- Real-time flight tracking API built with FastAPI
- MongoDB integration for data persistence
- Live flight management and archival system
- Location data ingestion via POST endpoints
- Interactive flight path visualization using Folium maps
- RESTful API for complete flight lifecycle management

TECH STACK:
- Backend: Python 3.8+ with FastAPI
- Database: MongoDB
- Server: Uvicorn (ASGI)
- Visualization: Folium
- Dependencies: pymongo, uvicorn, python-dotenv

MAIN ENDPOINTS:
- POST /flights - Register a new scheduled flight
- POST /ingest - Ingest location data (radio signals)
- GET /track/{flight_id} - Retrieve flight path
- GET /track/{flight_id}/map - Interactive map of flight path
- POST /flights/{flight_id}/complete - Mark flight as completed

REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- MongoDB running on localhost:27017
- All dependencies listed in requirements.txt

USE CASES:
- Flight tracking and monitoring system
- Aviation data management
- Real-time location tracking
- Flight history and analytics

INSTALLATION & SETUP:
1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Ensure MongoDB is running
3. Seed database (optional): python scripts/seed_db.py
4. Run server: uvicorn app.main:app --reload
