FLIGHTAWARE MIMIC API - SETUP & RUN INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

If you've cloned this project and don't have a virtual environment (venv) folder, follow these steps:

STEP 1: CREATE AND ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
================================================
On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate

After activation, you should see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt.


STEP 2: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
=============================
With the virtual environment activated, run:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all required packages:
- fastapi
- uvicorn[standard]
- pymongo
- python-dotenv
- folium


STEP 3: ENSURE MONGODB IS RUNNING
==================================
Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine at: mongodb://localhost:27017/

You can verify MongoDB is running by:
- Windows: Check if mongod.exe is running in Task Manager
- macOS: Check Activity Monitor for mongod
- Linux: Run: sudo systemctl status mongod

If MongoDB is not running, start it:
- Windows: mongod (from Command Prompt)
- macOS: brew services start mongodb-community
- Linux: sudo systemctl start mongod


STEP 4: (OPTIONAL) SEED THE DATABASE
=====================================
To populate the database with sample flight data, run:
  python scripts/seed_db.py

This will load sample flights from data/seed_flights.json into MongoDB.


STEP 5: RUN THE APPLICATION
============================
With the virtual environment activated, run:
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload

You should see output similar to:
  INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  Connected to MongoDB at mongodb://localhost:27017/


STEP 6: ACCESS THE APPLICATION
===============================
Open your browser and navigate to:
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc Documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc
- API Root: http://localhost:8000/

From the /docs page, you can test all API endpoints interactively.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
1. If you get "pip: command not found"
   - Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
   - Try: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

2. If you get "MongoDB connection refused"
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Check if MongoDB is on the default port 27017
   - Update MONGO_URI in app/database.py if needed

3. If you get "Module not found" errors
   - Make sure you activated the venv: .\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
   - Reinstall packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

4. If port 8000 is already in use
   - Run on a different port: uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001


DEACTIVATING VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
==================================
When you're done working, deactivate the virtual environment:
  deactivate

The (venv) prefix will disappear from your terminal prompt.
